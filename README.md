The data set we had chosen did not have any incomplete values.
Hence we removed a few values and worked on it to clean the dataset and fill in the missing values.

We have performed BoxPlot, histograms, heatmap( to find out correlation) and few more other graphs. 


We have performed Linear Regression on the data-set and it's in the file Linear_reg

Our final model where we find out what are the variables that will mostly influence the amount of calories in your item is done through Random Forest and in the file Random_Forest
